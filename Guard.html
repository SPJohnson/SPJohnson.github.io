<h1>Maine Air National Guard</h1>

<br>

<h3>Fly, Fight, Win!</h3>

<p>Growing up, I had never had an interest in joining the military. I was going to graduate from high school, go to college, graduate and make a lot of money. Although that is still my plan for life after UMaine, I also made the decision to enlist in the Maine Air National Guard, and it has been a decision that has changed my life in more ways than I could have predicted.</p>

<p>I took the Oath of Enlistment in June of 2014, just a few weeks after I graduated from Brewer. I made the decision to become a member of the 101st Security Forces Squadron. As an SF Specialist, I work in military law enforcement and base security. This career experience is invaluable to me and my future where I have aspirations of potentially working in federal law enforcement.</p>

<p>In the three years that I have been in the military, I have learned and matured more than I did in all four years of high school. I have met a lot of great people, made a lot of unforgettable memories and had a lot of fun. That being said, serving in the military, especially in my career field, is not always fun. I have been through taser and pepper spray certification courses, during which I was required to experience the effects of both in order to understand them if I ever had to apply these tactics in a real-world situation. Despite these experiences being extremely painful, they are both unique stories that I will never forget.</p>

<p>I am proud to be among the One Percent of Americans currently serving in the United States Armed Forces.</p>
