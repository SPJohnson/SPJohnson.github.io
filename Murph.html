<h1>Murphy</h1>

<br>

<h3>Meet Murphy!</h3>

<p>Murphy is mine and Cassie's adorable English bulldog. Cassie got him before we started dating, however, I have unofficially adopted him as my own. Murphy is 4-years-old and loves to go for walks downtown and on the waterfront. He also loves treats, chewing on his bones, and what Cassie and I call, "meditating," with his toy pig.</p>

<p>Being a male bulldog, Murphy is very territorial of our house and protective of Cassie. He is a great one-family dog. Whenever I have to stay the night away from home, my mind is at ease knowing that Murphy would do everything in his power to protect Cassie if something were to happen while I was gone. That being said, he is also very loving and gentle with most other people and dogs, especially when we are out in public.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot from Murphy, including lessons in patience, unconditional love and how to care for another being. Despite the fact that Cassie had Murphy before her and I began seeing each other, I still care for him as if he were my own and I love him like I've raised him since he was a puppy.</p>
