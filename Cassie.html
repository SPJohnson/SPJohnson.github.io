<h1>Cassie</h1>

<br>

<h3>Cassie is my best friend and girlfriend.</h3>

<p>Cassie and I met in October of 2015 when I started working at High Tide Restaurant & Bar. After working together for about eight months, we began dating and have been together since. Now, we live in our house in Brewer with our bulldog, Murphy, who is featured on my next page.</p>

<p>Cassie grew up in Bucksport, where she did well in school and excelled in soccer. After graduating from Bucksport High School, she attended Eastern Maine Community College and received her Associate's Degree in Liberal Studies. After working in restaurant management for a few years, she earned a position as a Payroll Specialist at Bangor Savings Bank, which is what she currently does for work. She is also a talented artist, a great dog mom and an amazing girlfriend.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for Cassie to become my best friend and better half, and she continues to amaze me everyday. She is creative, compassionate, thoughtful, patient and loyal. She is always able to put a smile on my face with her silly personality, and I love that she consistently teaches me something new, whether it's about her, life in general, or myself. I feel blessed to have been given the opportunity to be in a relationship with her, and I love her more everyday.</p>
