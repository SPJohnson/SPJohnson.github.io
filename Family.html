<h1>Family</h1>

<br>

<h3>My family is the most important aspect of my life. </h3>  

<p>My immediate family consists of my parents, Bobbi and Matt, my sister, Kyra, and my brother, Alex. They all live at the house I grew up in in Brewer. My mother is the Associate Director of Child Welfare for the State of Maine, while my father owns his own business, called Johnson's Precision Welding. My sister is a student at the University of Maine, studying Psychology with a concentration in Neuroscience. Additionally, she works full-time at Eastern Maine Medical Center as the Site Coordinator for ProScribe. My little brother attends 2nd grade at the Brewer Community School and plays baseball, hockey, and football.</p>

<p>I am very close with each member of my family and I have a great amount of love, respect and appreciation for all of them. Each of them has had a unique impact on the person I am today and continue to become, and I cannot thank them enough for their ongoing love and support. I know that they are always there if I need them. </p>
