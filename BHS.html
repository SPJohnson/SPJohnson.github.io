<h1>Brewer, ME.</h1>

<br>

<h3>My Hometown</h3>

<p>My family and I moved across the river to Brewer when I was in 2nd grade. Since then, I have grown up here, attended school here and continued to live here. My parents still live in the house where I spent the majority of my childhood, and my girlfriend and I now have our own house across town. Having lived here for so long, I have gotten to know a lot about the community and its members. It has been a pleasure to live here.</p>

<p>I have a lot of great memories from my time attending school in Brewer. By the time I graduated from Brewer High School in 2014, I had formed a lot of strong friendships with people I had gone to school with over the years. I had a great time running track and playing basketball and soccer, and I also learned a lot and did well academically.</p>

<p>Now, I am able to give back to the community by coaching my little brother's baseball, basketball, football and soccer teams. My dad and I volunteer every year and we always have a lot of fun coaching Alex and his friends. Even though I have plans of moving to a new city in a few years, I will always remember where my roots are here in Brewer.</p>
