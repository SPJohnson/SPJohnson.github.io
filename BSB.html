<h1>Bangor Savings Bank</h1>

<br>

<h3>You Matter More</h3>

<p>On top of being a full-time student, I am also a full-time employee of Bangor Savings Bank. I currently work as Teller at the Brewer branch. I was able to set up my schedule so I have classes on Tuesday and Thursday and I work Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. I enjoy being busy and I realize that it is beneficial for me to earn valuable work experience while I am in school.</p>

<p>Although working in customer service is not always my favorite, I like working at the Bank and have goals of transitioning into a different department when I am able to do so. I am interested in our Risk Management department, which deals with fraud, money-laundering and the physical and informational security aspects of the organization.</p>

<p>Bangor Savings Bank is a great company to work for. Aside from treating its employees well, the Bank is heavily involved in various communities throughout the state of Maine. We participate in a lot of fundraising and charity events, as well as host some of our own. </p>
