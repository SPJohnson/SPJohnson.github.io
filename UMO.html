<h1>University of Maine</h1>

<br>

<h3>Go Bears!</h3>

<p>I knew well before I graduated from high school that I wanted to attend the University of Maine. In fact, it was the only college/university that I applied to. For a long time I wanted to move to Boston right after high school and go to school there, however, I decided that it would be in my best interest to stay close to home and my family. After all, I wouldn't be able to begin a new year of school without my mom continuing her tradition of making signs and taking pictures.</p>

<p>Originally, I began at the University with a double-major in Accounting and Finance. After realizing that I had an interest in a lot of other areas of study, I jumped around to Political Science, Journalism, Communication and then finally settled into Business Management. This decision came after I was able to develop a better understanding of what I want to do upon graduation from UMaine.</p>

<p>I chose to study Management due to its wide application in the job market. I have an interest in Banking as well as potentially going into corporate law or law enforcement, so I have decided to maintain an open mind and keep my options open. Regardless of what I choose to do, I am really looking forward to earning my degree and starting my career and life after college.</p>
